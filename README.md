## Welcome to the Online Voting Tool

The Online Voting Tool presented by the Computational Social Choice research group at Technical University of Munich (TUM) offers an easy-to-use tool to compute [maximal lotteries](http://fishburn.ml/).
You can test it under [voting.ml](https://voting.ml) and learn more about social choice [here](http://dss.in.tum.de/14-research/research-projects/56-algorithmic-game-theory-and-computational-social-choice.html).

### Maintenance
* System status and uptime statistics can be checked at: [status.voting.ml](https://status.voting.ml/)

### Maximal Lotteries
Maximal lottery schemes return an optimal mixed strategy of the symmetric zero-sum game induced by the (\\(\tau\\)-scaled) majority margins. Formally, the set of maximal lotteries in the preference profile \\(R\\) with respect to \\(\tau\\) among the set of all lotteries \\(\Delta(A)\\) over the alternatives \\(A\\) is as follows:
\\[ \mathit{ML}^{{\tau}}(R) = \\{p\in\Delta(A)\colon\ p^t{\tau(M^R)}\ge 0\\}, \\]
where \\( {\tau}\colon\mathbb Z\rightarrow \mathbb R \\), \\({\tau(1)} = 1 \\) is *odd* and *monotone*. The default option for \\(\tau\\) is the identity function.
